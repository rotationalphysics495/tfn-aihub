# Sprint Status Tracking File
# Generated for tfn-aihub - AI Agent Tools Implementation Phase
# This file tracks the development lifecycle for Epics 5, 6, and 7

# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic not yet started
#   - in-progress: Epic actively being worked on
#   - done: All stories in epic completed
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - ready-for-dev: Story file created, ready for development
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation
#   - review: Implementation complete, ready for review
#   - done: Story completed
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - done: Retrospective has been completed
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Mark epic as 'in-progress' when starting work on its first story
# - SM typically creates next story ONLY after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', then Dev runs code-review (fresh context, ideally different LLM)

# Sprint Planning Summary
# ========================================
# Total Epics: 3
# Total Stories: 17
#
# Epic 5 (Agent Foundation & Core Tools): 8 stories
#   - Foundation stories (5.1-5.2): Framework setup and data abstraction
#   - Core tools (5.3-5.6): Asset, OEE, Downtime, Production tools
#   - Integration (5.7-5.8): Chat UI and caching
#
# Epic 6 (Safety & Financial Intelligence Tools): 4 stories
#   - Safety (6.1): Safety events tracking
#   - Financial (6.2-6.3): Impact and cost analysis
#   - Analytics (6.4): Trend analysis
#
# Epic 7 (Proactive Agent Capabilities): 5 stories
#   - Memory (7.1): Conversation recall
#   - Analysis (7.2): Comparative metrics
#   - Proactive (7.3-7.5): Actions, alerts, recommendations
#
# Recommended Implementation Order:
# 1. Epic 5 must be completed first (establishes agent framework)
# 2. Epic 6 depends on Epic 5 (extends with safety/financial tools)
# 3. Epic 7 depends on Epic 6 (adds proactive capabilities)
#
# Critical Path: 5.1 -> 5.2 -> (5.3-5.6 parallel) -> 5.7 -> 5.8 -> 6.x -> 7.x
