## Context References

The following files provide additional context for fixing these failures:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `/Users/heimdallagent/Documents/GitHub/tfn-aihub/_bmad-output/uat/epic-1-uat.md` | Full UAT document with all scenarios |
| `/Users/heimdallagent/Documents/GitHub/tfn-aihub/_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/1-*` | Story files with acceptance criteria |
| `/Users/heimdallagent/Documents/GitHub/tfn-aihub/_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/metrics/epic-1-metrics.yaml` | Execution metrics |

## Fix Instructions

Address the failures above in priority order. For each fix:

1. **Analyze** - Understand why the scenario failed
2. **Locate** - Find the relevant code files
3. **Fix** - Implement the minimum change to resolve the failure
4. **Verify** - Run the scenario command locally to confirm fix
5. **Commit** - Use message format: `fix(epic-1): {description}`

### Constraints

- Only fix the identified failures - do not refactor unrelated code
- Run the specific failing commands to verify each fix
- Run project tests after all fixes: `npm test`
- If a fix requires changes that would break other scenarios, document the tradeoff

## After Fixing

Once all fixes are committed, the UAT validation will automatically re-run.

- **If all pass:** Epic continues to next phase
- **If failures remain:** Another fix context will be generated (attempt 2)
- **If max retries exceeded:** Chain halts for human intervention
